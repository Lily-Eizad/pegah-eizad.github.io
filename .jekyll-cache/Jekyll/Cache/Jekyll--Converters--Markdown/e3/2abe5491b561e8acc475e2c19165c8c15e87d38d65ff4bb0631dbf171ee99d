I"˝<p>Here are the best two ways to conditionally render Components in React‚Äôs JSX
without using the ugly <code class="highlighter-rouge">if else</code>.</p>

<p>If you have an <code class="highlighter-rouge">if else</code> condition, use a <strong><em>ternary operator</em></strong>- 
You have cookbook app and you want to render <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;Food /&gt;</code> if the user is looking for
food recipes or <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;Drinks /&gt;</code> if the user is looking for drink recipes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jsx-ternary.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">isFood</code> could be local component state or a prop.</p>

<p>If you have an If but not an else use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code> operator-
For example you wanna display the user‚Äôs favorite recipes IF they have any.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/jsx-and.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>Where favorites either comes from local state or a prop.
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;&amp;</code> is the JavaScript logical ‚Äúand‚Äù and will check each expression in order. 
 So in our case, it will check if the user has any favorites and if that 
 evaluates to True, it will execute what follows which is rendering
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;FavoriteRecipes /&gt;</code> . For rendering <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;FavoriteRecipes /&gt;</code>, the &amp;&amp; operator will
 always evaluat to True as long as the component is there.</p>
